The study was performed in both males and females to identify potential sex differences in the sensory nociceptive transcriptome. Ganglia from specific spinal levels were selected to enable direct comparison of Trpv1 nociceptive neurons in mixed visceral/somatic ganglia (L6-S1) with the adjacent purely somatic ganglia (L4-L5). This enables identification of features unique to visceral nociceptive neurons that innervate the pelvic organs. The majority of these nociceptive neurons innervate the lower urinary tract and lower bowel, with a smaller population innervating reproductive organs. ",

DAPI (200 ng/ml) was added just prior to FACS sorting as a dead cell marker. Cells were sorted using a FACS Aria III (100um nozzle size and 20psi) and collected in 500ul RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) + 30ul 2M DTT. Cells were homogenised by passing them through a 25 gauge needle 3-4 times. Total RNA was then isolated from the cells using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen).

To activate expression of eGFP-L10a in PTEC, mice received 2 doses of 3 mg of tamoxifen gavage with one spare day within doses. According to our previous report, it achieved around 80% recombination in S1 and S2 segments of proximal tubules, and around 20-40% recombination in cortical S3 segments.Ten days after the last dose of tamoxifen, mice underwent left unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery, as previously described. Mice were euthanized and UUO and contralateral kidney (CLK) were harvested at 5 or 10 days after the surgery. Each group included 3 female and 4 male mice.",

Briefly, kidneys were removed and decapsulated after perfusion with iced-cold PBS. Renal cortex was rapidly dissected and minced on ice. Samples were then transferred to 1 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer for homogenization. Streptavidin Dyanbeads (MyOne T1, 65601, ThermoFisher), which were freshly coated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (clone 19C8 and clone 19F7, Rockefeller University Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility) through biotinylated Protein L (29997, ThermoFisher), were added to the kidney postmitochondrial supernatants and incubated at 4\u00b0C under end-over-end rotation for 4 hours for immunoprecipitation. After that, beads were collected on a magnetic rack, and the unbound fraction of samples were taken. Collected beads were then washed 4 times by high-salt washing buffer. All of the bound and unbound fractions of RNA were then extracted and purified by RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (74204, Qiagen) with in-column DNase digestion (RNase-free DNase set, 79254, Qiagen).",

To activate expression of eGFP-L10a in PTEC, mice received 2 doses of 3 mg of tamoxifen gavage with one spare day within doses. According to our previous report, it achieved around 80% recombination in S1 and S2 segments of proximal tubules, and around 20-40% recombination in cortical S3 segments.Ten days after the last dose of tamoxifen, mice underwent left unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery, as previously described. Mice were euthanized and UUO and contralateral kidney (CLK) were harvested at 5 or 10 days after the surgery. Each group included 3 female and 4 male mice.\n",

Streptavidin Dyanbeads (MyOne T1, 65601, ThermoFisher), which were freshly coated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (clone 19C8 and clone 19F7, Rockefeller University Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility) through biotinylated Protein L (29997, ThermoFisher), were added to the kidney postmitochondrial supernatants and incubated at 4\u00b0C under end-over-end rotation for 4 hours for immunoprecipitation. After that, beads were collected on a magnetic rack, and the unbound fraction of samples were taken. Collected beads were then washed 4 times by high-salt washing buffer. All of the bound and unbound fractions of RNA were then extracted and purified by RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (74204, Qiagen) with in-column DNase digestion (RNase-free DNase set, 79254, Qiagen).\n",

The study was performed in both male and female embryos to identify potential sex differences in the immature sensory transcriptome. Dorsal root ganglia from specific spinal levels were selected to compare mixed visceral/somatic ganglia (L6-S1) with the adjacent purely somatic ganglia (L4-L5). This enables identification of features unique to visceral neurons that innervate the pelvic organs. The majority of these sensory neurons innervate the lower urinary tract and lower bowel, with a smaller population innervating reproductive organs. ",

        "Description": "This comprises transcriptome data (bulk RNAseq) from primary sensory neurons isolated from adult (6-8 weeks) mouse dorsal root ganglia. The study was performed in both males and females to identify potential sex differences in the sensory transcriptome. Dorsal root ganglia from specific spinal levels were selected to compare mixed visceral/somatic ganglia (L6-S1) with the adjacent purely somatic ganglia (L4-L5). This enables identification of features unique to visceral neurons that innervate the pelvic organs. The majority of these sensory neurons innervate the lower urinary tract and lower bowel, with a smaller population innervating reproductive organs. ",
